				THE INNOVATION IMPERATIVE

			Chapter 1 on how important it is to innovate in the UK railway industry.
		</h2>
	</div>

	<p>Rail is a service. People rely on it to see family and friends, go to work, do business, and travel. The industry needs to constantly evolve and reinvent itself if it is to meet the ever-changing needs and expectations of its customers. It has an innovation imperative, just like any other industry or public service.</p>

	<p>Many of the early breakthroughs in rail travel were heralded by innovations developed in the UK. In 1825, the first locomotive-hauled public railway in the world ran the 25 miles between Stockton and Darlington. Five years later, the line between Liverpool and Manchester became the first financially viable public railway. The first passenger season tickets were issued in Canterbury in 1831.</p>

	<p>Today, the UK passenger rail industry has many strengths. It has coped with passenger numbers doubling over the past two decades, it has a world class safety record, and the quality of infrastructure compares favorably to rail systems in other major economies. </p>

	<p>Crucially, though, it also has many weaknesses. A lower percentage of trains run ‘on time’ than in most European countries, there is chronic overcrowding on many commuter routes, and consumers feel they lack power because of a perceived lack of competition on passenger routes. </p>

	<p>But, above all, the UK passenger rail industry is falling behind other industries on innovation. Whether introducing new ways to pay, keep customers updated, or enabling customers to link seamlessly with other services, rail is behind the curve. This lack of innovation results in two key issues: lower levels of customer satisfaction than in comparable industries; and falling levels of productivity in passenger rail operations, which puts pressure on rail fares. </p>

	<p>Rail has huge potential to innovate if it can overcome the key barriers identified in this report. A wave of potential new infrastructure investment - such as HS2, Crossrail 2 and the electrification of existing routes - provides an unprecedented opportunity to rethink how services are provided. If the UK can harness its tech sector, it can revolutionise rail in the UK and it could export ideas around the world, just as is happening already in fintech. </p>

		<h2>
			A LACK OF INNOVATION AND WHY THIS MATTERS
		</h2>
	</a>

	<p>The lack of innovation is evident from how far behind rail is compared with other industries in the take-up of new technology. Ticketing and wifi onboard trains are perhaps two of the most visible for customers. Just 20% of train tickets are bought online compared with 80% in the airline industry. And most rail tickets are paper-based. Passengers have to carry these throughout their journey, and return tickets need to be kept for up to a month. When it comes to wifi, more than half of the 27 train operating companies do not provide any wifi services on-board their trains, whether free or paid-for. </p>

	<p>These are just two of the most visible parts of the industry. The lack of innovation is pervasive though. It be seen from the low levels of investment in R&D, which has long been acknowledged by the industry. The 2012 Rail Technical Strategy – which was produced “for, and on behalf of, the rail industry in Great Britain” – cited data showing that just 0.5% of revenues had been invested in R&D compared with “international best practice” of 3.5%. Network Rail’s Technical Strategy, which was published a year later, also acknowledged that as an organisation it had been “under-investing in R&D by any benchmarked standard."</p>

	<p>This lack of innovation leads has caused two major issues for the rail industry. Lower levels of customer satisfaction than comparable industries. And falling productivity, which has  contributed to rising prices. </p>

	<a class="report-section-link" href="#">
		<h2>
			Lower levels of customer satisfaction than comparable industries
		</h2>
	</a>

	<p>Passenger rail has fallen behind other comparable industries on customer satisfaction due to this lack of innovation. The most innovative businesses are setting new standards all the time in the way that they interact with their customers. Increasingly, customers expect the same level of service from their taxi app, broadband provider or takeaway delivery service that they do from rail. In this sense, train operating companies are in competition with brands operating in altogether different markets. Along many routes they are also directly in competition with other rail franchises or open access operators, or other modes of transport. </p>

	<p>On measures of customer satisfaction that do not compare rail to other industries, UK passenger rail performs reasonably well. The level of overall satisfaction among respondents to the National Rail Passenger Survey has steadily increased over recent years. Furthermore, of the 26 countries covered in the European Commission’s survey of more than 26,000 Europeans, only Finland scored a higher overall passenger satisfaction rating than the UK.</p>

	<p>However, research by the ORR has found that "passengers have little knowledge or confidence in performance statistics”. The research also found that “Most struggle to recall having heard or seen anything about performance measurement." The issues with the existing measures of passenger satisfaction are discussed further in chapter xx. </p>

	<p>Furthermore, when passenger rail services are compared to other comparable services, satisfaction is comparatively low. Research by the Office for Rail and Road, which involved a survey of more than 1,000 households, has found that two thirds (66%) of customers are quite or very satisfied with rail services, lower than for mobile phones, banks, internet providers, or air travel. The fact that satisfaction levels are significantly lower when users are asked about more than just rail simay be due to customers’ expectations of standards in passenger rail services being influenced by their past experience of rail services. </p>

	<a class="report-section-link" href="#">

			Lower levels of customer satisfaction than comparable industries
		</h2>
	</a>

	<p>Unlike in many other transport services, productivity in passenger rail has fallen in recent years. Our analysis of the real cost per train for UK passenger train operations shows that productivity for passenger train operations has fallen by 26% between 2010/11 and 2013/14, the latest data available. This analysis excludes infrastructure maintenance, renewals and enhancements, as well as the cost of leasing rolling stock, since these costs cannot be directly affected by the types of innovation in customer experience discussed in this report.</p>

	<p>Productivity in passenger rail was identified in Sir Roy Mcnulty’s Rail value for money study, which reported to the government in 2011. The Mcnulty report found that productivity, measured as real cost per passenger kilometre, was roughly the same in 2009-10 as it had been fifteen years earlier. Our analysis, which shows that it has since fallen dramatically,  focused on the measure of real cost per train since this accounts for the fact that trains have become more crowded over time. Nonetheless, we have also updated the measure used in the Mcnulty report. On this measure, productivity for passenger train operations (excluding infrastructure and rolling stock), fell by 17% between 2010/11 and 2013/14.</p>

	<p>Alongside falling productivity, passenger rail fares have increased by almost a quarter in real terms over the past two decades. Customers in general do not seem to think that fare rises have been commensurate with better service levels. Just 22% of rail customers are quite or very satisfied with value for money, compared to 57% for mobile phone services, 45% for internet services and 33% for air travel. </p>

	<p>Fare increases in rail are partly due to a shift away from government subsidies and the need to support new infrastructure investment. But other industries have also had to upgrade infrastructure. Moreover, the fact that train operating costs make up a third of total costs suggests that savings could be made if train operating companies were as innovative as the best businesses and industries.</p>

	<p>Two other industries in particular highlight how it is possible to increase productivity, improve customer satisfaction and reduce prices:</p>

	<a class="report-section-link" href="#">
		<h2>
			WHAT DO WE MEAN BY INNOVATION IN RAIL? 
		</h2>
	</a>

	<p>Innovation can improve the customer experience and operational efficiency of rail by developing new or improved services, processes or organisational practices. It is inextricably linked to what customers want. Many of customers' top issues require major infrastructure investment to solve them but many others do not. The top three issues for customers, according to Transport Focus’ 2014 survey of more than 3,500 rail users across Great Britain, were: better value for money; being able to get a seat; and more frequent trains at times that customers wish to travel. These are all challenges largely determined by the rail network. Nonetheless, innovation in train operations can help meet even some of these issues, such as by providing customers with new or improved information about overcrowded trains. This can enable passengers in some cases to choose alternative trains, thereby improving their satisfaction with the service and relieving pressure on other routes. </p>

	<p>Furthermore, many of the other top issues identified by customers can be addressed directly by devising news ways to deliver rail services. Three of the top ten issues for rail passengers were being kept informed about delays, provided with accurate and timely information available at stations, and having access to free wi-fi on trains. The UK is home to many entrepreneurs and innovators focused on identifying solutions to these challenges. These solutions can involve cutting edge technology but very often simply take a fresh perspective on current approaches or apply innovations that are being successfully put into practice in other industries. </p>
